# Build Parent

A Simple maven build parent that configures and customizes builds for all child modules.  This can be used
by any project that would like to inherit these build configurations. This includes a number of the compiling,
code quality, code style, and plugin configurations of Tinkar and related HL7 projects.

The output of this project is solely a pom file and is distributed via standard Maven release procedures.
